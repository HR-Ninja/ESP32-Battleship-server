# Battleships ESP32

A command-line implementation of the classic **Battleships game**, played between a **client** (running on your computer) and a **server** running on an **ESP32**.  
The project is written entirely in **C** and communicates over a simple socket interface.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Play Battleships against an ESP32 server.
- Command-line interface for the client.
- Lightweight implementation in pure C.
- Works without additional dependencies (beyond standard ESP-IDF for the ESP32).

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- **ESP32 toolchain** (ESP-IDF installed and set up)
- **C compiler** (e.g., `gcc` or `clang`) for the client
- Serial/USB connection to flash the ESP32
- (Optional, WIP) CMake build system

## STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
